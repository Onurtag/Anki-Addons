# Anki-Addons
General repository for Anki addons I develop

## Throughput Monitor
Tries to gamify Anki. It does the following
1) Measures your studies in block of time (say a 10 minutes) through a countdown bar
2) Measures a rolling average of how much you study in the given timespan
3) Show you how many cards you've studied in this timespan compared to your average
4) If you surpass the rolling average, a flame will appear to show you that you're on fire!

This addon is specially made to be compatible with https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2091361802

Here is an example of me studying on a 1 minute countdown while also using the Progress Bar plugin

## Historical Throughput

Adds a new graph to the statistics screen that shows you your historical throughput on Anki

## True Retention Graph

Creates graphs to show your retention of cards over time.
Useful to know to adjust your card ease settings to avoid over-forgetting

**Note**: This is not originally my addon. I just added some features. I will share this code with the author if they ever publish their project on Github

## StudyAhead Audio

Exports the audio from the cards you haven't reviewed yet into a file
The hope is that you can listen to these while doing work that stops you from studying but doesn't stop you from listening to something
Thay way when you have time to study, you will be used to the audio and can study faster

**Note**: This is not based off any scientific evidence that this would be useful. Hopefully it's useful to you.
