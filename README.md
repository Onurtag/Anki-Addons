# Anki-Addons
General repository for Anki addons I develop

## Throughput Monitor
Tries to gamify Anki. It does the following
1) Measures your studies in block of time (say a 10 minutes) through a countdown bar
2) Measures a rolling average of how much you study in the given timespan
3) Show you how many cards you've studied in this timespan compared to your average
4) If you surpass the rolling average, a flame will appear to show you that you're on fire!

This addon is specially made to be compatible with https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2091361802

Here is an example of me studying on a 1 minute countdown while also using the Progress Bar plugin

Adds a new graph to the statistics screen that shows you your historical throughput on Anki
