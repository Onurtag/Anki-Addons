# Anki-Addons
General repository for Anki addons I develop

## Throughput Monitor
Tries to gamify Anki. It does the following
1) Measures a rolling average of how much you study in a give timespan (say 10 minutes)
2) Show you a countdown of of this time (say a 10 minute countdown)
3) Show you how many cards you've studied in this timespan compared to your average

This addon is specially made to be compatible with https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2091361802

Here is an example of me studying on a 1 minute countdown while also using the Progress Bar plugin
