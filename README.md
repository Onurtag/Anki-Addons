Note: the x-axis for this graph is not meaningful since it represents the number of batches instead of a specific time interval

## True Retention Graph

Creates graphs to show your retention of cards over time.
Useful to know to adjust your card ease settings to avoid over-forgetting

**Note**: This is not originally my addon. I just added some features. I will share this code with the author if they ever publish their project on Github
